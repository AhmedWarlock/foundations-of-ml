# Foundations of Machine Learning

This repository contains the foundational concepts and implementations of machine learning algorithms. It serves as a starting point for understanding and implementing various machine learning techniques.

## Table of Contents

- [Logistic Regression](#logistic-regression)
- [NN from Scratch](#nn-from-scratch)

## Logistic Regression

The "Logistic Regression" folder contains the implementation and examples of logistic regression, a popular binary classification algorithm. Logistic regression is widely used in machine learning and is a fundamental algorithm for understanding the basics of classification.

In this folder, you will find:

- `logistic_regression.py`: Python implementation of logistic regression algorithm.
- `data_processing.py`: Module for data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- `examples.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with examples demonstrating the usage of logistic regression on different datasets.

## NN from Scratch

The "NN from Scratch" folder contains the implementation of a neural network from scratch using only basic Python libraries. This folder aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the internals of a neural network and the process of building it from the ground up.

In this folder, you will find:

- `neural_network.py`: Python implementation of a basic neural network architecture.
- `data_processing.py`: Module for data preprocessing and normalization.
- `examples.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with examples demonstrating the usage of the neural network on various datasets.
